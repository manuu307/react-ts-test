### Home Assignment | Ssr Full-Stack Developer @ Pento

## Description
> Your task is to create the list view of a recipe app in React, given a mockup and a tech specification. The app uses the The Meal DB API to retrieve the data.

## Technical Specification
The app must have:
- A search bar.
- A list of meals that resulted from the search showing fields id, name, area, category.
- A field to filter by category.
- A custom hook useMeals to fetch data from the API.

### Not mandatory, but it would be nice if the app had:
- Typescript.
- Auto refetching built from scratch on the useMeals hook, to re-validate data every 10 seconds (no libraries allowed).
- A field to filter by area.
- Pagination.
